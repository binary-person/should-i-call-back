Link to the app: https://should-i-call-back.binary-person.dev

## Background

This project is dedicated to providing an easy way to determine if the phone number that called you is legitimate. Though the lookup data is accurate, the analysis of the phone number may not be.

## Procedure on updating the analyzer's data

1. go to [data.json](data.json) and change the necessary items
2. make a pull request. Be sure to provide the responsible phone numbers that are either a scammer's or a legitimate business's.
3. wait for me to accept your PR
4. analyzer gets updated!
